    <p>
      I am a dedicated and motivated professional currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/information-for-overview/prospective-align-pillar/">Northeastern University</a> in Seattle, WA. With a strong academic (a GPA of 4.0) and research (<a href="https://codingheather.github.io/">a research page of computer vision</a>) backgrounds , I am passionate about leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute to the field of software engineering. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to my current studies, I received both recruitement and honor scholarship and embarked on a Veterinary Medicine program at the <a href="https://www.vet.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where I obtained a solid foundation in animal care and husbandry practices. Although I ultimately decided to shift my focus to computer science, my experience in the field has instilled in me a meticulous attention to detail and a compassionate approach to communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my undergraduate years at <a href="https://www.fandm.edu/chemistry">Franklin & Marshall College</a>, where I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry, I excelled academically with a cumulative GPA of 3.72. Throughout my studies, I engaged in a wide range of coursework, including mathematics, biology, sociology, and various chemistry disciplines. This multidisciplinary approach has equipped me with a well-rounded skill set and a comprehensive understanding of scientific principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my academic pursuits, I have actively contributed to research projects in both the scientific and computational fields. Notably, I <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c05954">co-authored a publication</a> in The Journal of Physical Chemistry B, showcasing my ability to navigate complex scientific concepts and communicate research findings effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, I possess a diverse set of technical skills, including proficiency in programming languages such as Python, C, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript. I am also experienced in utilizing various software tools and libraries, including Processing, PyTorch, VSCode, Intellij, PyTest, JUnit, Gradle, ChatGPT, OpenAI, React Native, NPM, XCode, NextJS, Postman, Git, Github, AWS and Microsoft Office. In laboratory settings, I have gained expertise in techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and protein expression and purification.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a neurodivergent candidate, who is fluent in both Mandarin and English, I am adept at navigating multicultural environments and collaborating effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strong academic foundation, a passion for computer science, and a commitment to continuous learning, I am eager to contribute my skills and experiences to make a meaningful impact in the field.
