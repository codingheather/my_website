1.- Create a Static Home Page Using HTML and CSS (30%)
Your task is to design the front end of a website.
Use HTML for the structure of the webpage (like headers, paragraphs, images, links, etc.).
Use CSS to style the webpage (like colors, fonts, layout, etc.).

2.-Your Homepage Must Have More Than One Page (Different .html Pages) (20%)
Your website should not consist of just a single page.
Create additional HTML pages. Each page will have its own .html file.
These pages could be anything like 'About Us', 'Contact', 'Services', etc.

3.-Your Homepage Should Have a Menu That Takes You to the Different Pages (15%)
Implement a navigation menu on your homepage.
Use <a> tags to create links in this menu. Each link should take the user to a different HTML page within your website.
For instance, clicking on 'About Us' in the menu should open the about.html page.

4.-Add JavaScript to Your Homepage (20%)
Introduce interactivity on your webpage using JavaScript.
Include a button that, when clicked, changes the Document Object Model (DOM).
This could be anything like adding new sections to the page, changing text, or dynamically modifying the layout.

5.-Include a Separate Button That Adds/Removes a CSS Class (15%)
Add another button to your homepage that has the functionality to add or remove a CSS class from elements on your webpage.
Use JavaScript for this functionality, particularly the classList API as mentioned in this doc (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classListLinks to an external site.)
This could be used to change the styling of elements. For example, clicking the button might change the color of a text or the background of a section.

In summary, you are building a multi-page static website with a navigation menu, incorporating JavaScript to interactively modify the webpage's content and its styling. This assignment is designed to give you hands-on experience with the basics of web development, including webpage structuring, styling, and scripting.

It's important to note that in this assignment, the content of the website itself (like the text, images, or specific topics of each page) is irrelevant for grading purposes. The focus is primarily on demonstrating your technical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This includes how well you structure multiple pages, implement a navigation menu, and utilize JavaScript for DOM manipulation and CSS class alterations. The emphasis is on the functionality and technical aspects rather than the actual content or thematic elements of the website.
